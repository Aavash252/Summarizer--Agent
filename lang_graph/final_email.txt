Subject: Absence Due to Illness

Dear [Teacher's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently unwell and will be unable to attend class today. I have been advised to rest.

I would appreciate it if you could let me know whether any documentation is required for my absence. I am happy to provide a doctor's note if needed.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will catch up on the missed work as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
